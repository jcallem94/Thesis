We study the LHC sensitivity to a $W^{\prime}$ produced via bottom ($b$) and charm ($c$) quarks and decaying to  $\tau$ flavor leptons in the mass range 200-1000 GeV. We show that the extra $b$ quarks necessitated by the production mechanism can improve the background rejection compared to an inclusive analysis relying solely on $\tau$-tagging and $E^{\text{miss}}_T$. We present prospective limits on the couplings and compare them to the best fit to the $R (D^{(*)})$ anomalies in $B$ meson decays.
